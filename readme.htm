<H2><A NAME = "introduction">Introduction</A></H2>

<B>POST++</B> provides simple and effective storage for 
application objects. <B>POST++</B> is based on memory mapping mechanism 
and shadow pages transactions. <B>POST++</B> eliminates any overhead on 
persistent objects access.
Moreover <B>POST++</B> supports work with several storages, 
storing objects with virtual functions, atomic data file update,
provides high performance memory allocator and optional garbage collector for
implicit deallocation of memory. <B>POST++</B> correctly works
with C++ classes using multiple inheritance and pointers inside 
objects.<P> 


<H2><A NAME = "classinfo">Describing object class</A></H2>

POST++ storage manager needs information about persistent object classes
to support garbage collection, relocation of references while loading,
and initialization of pointers to virtual tables. Unfortunately
C++ language provides no facilities to extract information about class
format at runtime. As far as I want to avoid use of some special tools
(preprocessors) or some "dirty trick" solutions (extracting information
about classes from debugging information), this information should
be provided to storage manager by programmer. Such class registration
can be done very easy using special macros provided by POST++.<P>

POST++ uses default constructors for initializing object while loading
from storage. The programmer should include macro 
<CODE>CLASSINFO(NAME, FIELD_LIST)</CODE> in definition of any class, which
instances can be saved in the storage. <CODE>NAME</CODE> corresponds to the 
name of this class. <CODE>FIELD_LIST</CODE> describes reference fields of this 
class. There are three macros defined in file 
<A HREF = "classinfo.h">classinfo.h</A> for describing references:

<DL>
<DT><CODE>REF(x)</CODE><DD>
Describes single reference field.
<DT><CODE>REFS(x)</CODE><DD>
Describes one-dimensional fixed array of references. 
(i.e. array with constant boundaries).
<DT><CODE>VREFS(x)</CODE><DD>
Describes varying one-dimensional array of references. Varying array can be
only the last component in class. When you are writing class declaration, you
specify array with only one element. The actual number of elements in concrete
object instance is specified at object creation time. 
</DL><P>

List of these macros should be separates by spaces: 
<CODE>REF(a) REF(b) REFS(c)</CODE>. 
Macro <CODE>CLASSINFO</CODE> defines default constructor (constructor without
parameters) and declares class descriptor of this class. Class descriptor
is static component of the class with name <CODE>self_class</CODE>. 
So class descriptor of the class <CODE>foo</CODE> can be accessed by
<CODE>foo::self_class</CODE>. As far as constructors without arguments
are called for base classes and components automatically by compiler,
you should not worry about calling them explicitly. But do not forget
to include <CLASS>CLASSINFO</CLASS> macro in definition of any structure,
which can be used as component of serialized class. Then you should
register your class to be accessible by storage manager. 
It can be done by macro <CODE>REGISTER(NAME)</CODE>. Class names
are placed in the storage together with objects. Mapping between application
and storage classes is established during storage opening. Names of all classes
stored in the storage are compared with names of application classes.
If some class name is not found within application classes or 
correspondent application and storage classes have different size, then 
program assertion will fail.<P>


These rules are illustrated by the following example:

<PRE>
struct branch { 
    object* obj;
    int key;

    CLASSINFO(branch, REF(obj));
};

class foo : public object { 
  protected:
    foo*    next;
    foo*    prev;
    object* arr[10];
    branch  branches[8];
    int     x;
    int     y;
    object* childs[1];
  public:
    CLASSINFO(foo, REF(next) REF(prev) REFS(arr) VREFS(linked));
    foo(int x, int y);
};


REGISTER(1, foo);

main() { 
    storage my_storage("foo.odb");
    if (my_storage.open()) { 
        my_root_class* root = (my_root_class*)my_storage.get_root_object();
	if (root == NULL) { 
	    root = new_in(my_storage, my_root)("some parameters for root");
	}
	...
        int n_childs = ...;
	size_t varying_size = (n_childs-1)*sizeof(object*);
	// We should subtract 1 from n_childs, because one element is already
	// present in fixed part of class.
        foo* fp = new (foo:self_class, my_storage, varying_size) foo(x, y);
	...
	my_storage.close();
    }	
}
</PRE><P>

<H2><A NAME = "creation">Allocating and deallocating objects in storage</A></H2>

POST++ provides special memory allocator for managing storage memory.
This allocator uses two different approaches: for allocating small and
large objects. All storage memory is divided into pages (which size 
is independent from operating system page size and in current implementation
of POST++ is 512 bytes). Small objects are those objects, which
size is less or equal to 256 bytes (page size/2). These objects are allocated
using fixed block chains. Each chain contains the list of blocks with the 
same size. Sizes of allocated objects are aligned at 8-byte
boundary. The optimal number of fixed block chains for objects with size not 
greater than 256 is 14 (number of different equipartitions of the page).
Before each object POST++ allocates object header, which contains
class identifier of the object and object size. As far as size of header is
exactly 8 bytes and in C++ size of object is always greater than 0, 
block chain with size 8 can be eliminated. 
Allocation and deallocation of small object usually is very fast: 
it requires only one remove/insert operation from L1 list. 
If the chain is empty and we are attempting to allocate
new object, then new page is allocated and used for storing objects of this 
size (page is divided into the blocks, which are appended to the chain).
Space for large object (with size greater than 256 bytes) is allocated
from free page list. Size of large objects is aligned on page boundary.
POST++ uses first feed, random position algorithm for maintaining list
of free pages (all free segments of pages are sorted by their address and
special pointer is used to follow current position in this list).
Implementation of memory manager can be found in file
<A HREF = "storage.cxx">storage.cxx</A><P>

If typical size of the objects in your application is slightly larger than 256 bytes, 
you can build post with <code>LARGE_OBJECTS</code> macro defined. In this case 1024 byte pages
will be used with 18 block chains. Size of small object will be limited by 512 bytes.<P>

It is up to the programmer whether to use explicit or implicit memory 
deallocation. Explicit memory deallocation is faster 
(especially for small objects) but implicit deallocation (garbage collection) 
is more reliable. In POST++ mark and sweep garbage collection scheme is used.
There is special object in the storage: <EMP>root object</EMP>. 
Garbage collector first marks all objects accessible from the root object
(i.e. it is possible to reach the object starting from the root object, and
navigating through references). Then all objects that are not marked
during first stage of GC will be deallocated.
Garbage collection can be made during loading objects from the file
(if you pass <CODE>do_garbage_collection</CODE> attribute to 
<CODE>storage::open()</CODE> method). It is also possible to explicitly
invoke garbage collection during program execution by calling 
<CODE>storage::do_mark_and_sweep()</CODE> method. But be sure that there are
no program variable pointed to objects inaccessible from the root objects 
(these objects will be deallocated by GC).<P>

Because of multiple inheritance C++ classes can have non zero offset
within object and references inside object are possible. That is why
we have to use special techniques to access object header. 
POST++ maintains page allocation bitmap each bit of which corresponds to
the page in the storage. If some large object is allocated
at several pages, then bits corresponding to all pages occupied by this object
except first one will be set to 1. All other pages have correspondent bits in 
bitmap cleared.  To find start address of the object, we first align pointer 
value on the page size. Then POST++ finds page in bitmap that contains 
beginning of the object (this page should have zero bit in bitmap). 
Then we extract information about the object size from object header placed 
at the beginning of this page. If size is greater than half of page size then 
we have already found object descriptor: it is at the beginning of the page. 
Otherwise we calculate fixed block size used for this page and round down 
offset of pointer within this page to block size. This scheme of
header location is used by garbage collector, <CODE>operator delete</CODE>
defined in <CODE>object</CODE> class and by methods extracting information
from the object header about object size and class.<P>

In POST++ special overloaded <CODE>new</CODE> method is provided
for allocation of objects in the storage. This method takes as extra 
parameters class descriptor of created object, storage in which object
should be created and, optionally, size of varying part of the object instance.
Macro <CODE>new_in(STORAGE, CLASS)</CODE> provides 
"syntax sugar" for persistent object creation. 
Persistent object can be delete by redefined <CODE>operator delete</CODE>. 


<H2><A NAME = "object">Persistent object protocol</A></H2>

All classes of persistent objects in POST++ should be derived from
<CODE>object</CODE> class defined in <A HREF = "object.h">object.h</A>. 
This class contains no variables and provides methods for object 
allocation/deallocation and obtaining
information about object class and size at runtime. It is possible to 
use <CODE>object</CODE> class as one of multiple bases of inheritance
(order of bases is not significant). Each persistent class should
have constructor which is used by POST++ system (see section 
<A HREF="#classinfo">Describing object class</A>).
That means that you should not use constructor without parameters for
normal object initialization. If your class constructor even has no
meaningful parameters, you should add dummy one to distinguish your
constructor with constructor created by macro <CODE>CLASSINFO</CODE>.<P>

To access objects in persistent storage programmer needs some kind of root
object from which each other object in storage can be accessed by normal 
C pointers. POST++ storage provides two methods allowing you to specify and 
obtain reference to the root object:

<PRE>
        void    set_root_object(object* obj);
        object* get_root_object();
</PRE>

When you create new storage <CODE>get_root_object()</CODE> returns NULL.
You should create root object and store reference to it by 
<CODE>set_root_object()</CODE> method. Next time you are opening storage, 
root object can be retrieved by <CODE>get_root_object()</CODE>.<P>

<B><I>Hint</I></B>: In practice application classes used to be changed during 
program development and support. Unfortunately POST++ due to its simplicity
provides no facilities for automatic object conversion (see for example
lazy object update scheme in  
<A HREF = "http://www.ispras.ru/~knizhnik/goods.html">GOODS</A>), 
So to avoid problems with adding new fields to the objects, I can recommend
you to reserve some free space in objects for future use. This is especially 
significant for root object, because it is first candidate for adding new 
components. You should also avoid reverse references to the root object. 
If no other object has reference to the root objects, then root object
can be simply changed (by means of <CODE>set_root_object</CODE> method)
to instance of new class. POST++ storage provides methods for setting
and retrieving storage version identifier. This identifier can be used
by application for updating objects in the storage depending on the storage
and the application versions.<P>

<H2><A NAME = "storage::new">Storage constructor</A></H2>

You can use several storages in your application simultaneously. 
Storage constructor takes one mandatory argument - path to the storage file.
If this file has no extension, then POST appends suffix ".odb" to the name
of the file.
This file name is also used by POST++ to form names of some auxiliary files:<P>

<TABLE>
<TR><TH>file description</TH><TH>when used</TH><TH>suffix</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>temporary file with new storage image</TD>
<TD>used in non-transaction mode to store new image of storage</TD>
<TD>".tmp"</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>transaction log file</TD>
<TD>used in transaction mode to saved shadow pages</TD>
<TD>".log"</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>saved copy of storage file</TD>
<TD>used only in Windows-95 for renaming temporary file</TD>
<TD>".sav"</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

Two other parameters of storage constructor have default values.
First of them <CODE>max_file_size</CODE> specifies limitation of 
storage file extension. If storage file is larger than 
<CODE>storage::max_file_size</CODE> then it will not be truncated but
further extends are not possible. If <CODE>max_file_size</CODE> is 
greater than the file size, then behavior depends on storage opening mode.
In transaction mode, file is mapped on memory with read-write protection.
Windows-NT/95 extends in this case size of the file till 
<CODE>max_file_size</CODE>. The file size will be truncated by 
<CODE>storage::close()</CODE> method to the boundary of last object allocated 
in the storage. In Windows it is necessary to have at least 
<CODE>storage::max_file_size</CODE> free bytes on disk to successfully
open storage in read-write mode even if you are not going to add new objects 
in the storage.<P>

The last parameter of storage constructor is <CODE>max_locked_objects</CODE>,
This parameter is used only in transaction mode to provide buffering
of shadow pages writes to the transaction log file. To provide 
data consistency POST++ should guarantee that shadow page will be 
saved in the transaction log file before modified page will
be flushed on disk. POST++ use one of two approaches:
synchronous log writes (<CODE>max_locked_objects == 0</CODE>)
and buffered writes with locking of pages in memory. By locking
page in the memory, we can guaranty that it will not be swapped out 
on disk before transaction log buffers. Shadow pages are written to
the transaction log file in asynchronous mode (with operating system
cashing enabled). When number of locked pages exceeds 
<CODE>max_locked_pages</CODE>, log file buffers are flushed on disk
and all locked pages are unlocked. Such approach can significantly
increase transaction performance (up to 5 times under NT). But unfortunately
different operating systems use different approaches to locking pages in 
memory. 

<UL>
<LI> Windows 95 doesn't support it at all. 
<LI> In Windows NT every process can lock it's pages, but total number of 
     locked pages should not exceed process working set quota. By default 
     process can't lock more than 30 pages. If you specify 
     <CODE>max_locked_pages</CODE> parameter greater than 30, than 
     POST++ will try to extend process working set to feet your
     requirement. But my experiments show that difference in performance
     with 30 and 60 locked pages is very negligible. 
<LI> In Unix only superuser can lock pages in memory. That is why
     file constructor checks if process has enough permissions
     to use lock operations. So if you specify <CODE>max_locked_pages</CODE>
     parameter greater than 0, then decision whether to use synchronous or
     asynchronous writes to the transaction log file will be taken at 
     moment of storage class creation. If you want to use benefits of
     memory locking mechanism (2-5 times, depending on type of transaction),
     you should change owner of your application to <CODE>root</CODE> and
     grant <CODE> set-user-ID</CODE> permission:	 
     <CODE>chmod +s application</CODE>.
     
</UL><P>


<H2><A NAME = "storage::open">Opening storage</A></H2>
 
POST++ uses memory mapping mechanism for accessing data from 
the file. Two different approaches are used in POST++ to provide
storage data consistency. First and more advanced is based on
transaction mechanism using shadow pages to provide storage recovery
after fault and transaction rollback. <I>Before write shadow page creation</I>
algorithm is used. This algorithm is implemented in the following way: 
all mapped on file pages are set to readonly protection. Any write
access to such page will cause access violation exception. This exception
is handled by special handler, which change page protection to
read-write and place copy of this page in transaction log file (log file name 
is combined from the original data file name and suffix ".log").
All following write accesses to this page will not cause page faults.
Storage method <CODE>commit()</CODE> flushes all modified pages on disk and
truncates the log file. <CODE>storage::commit()</CODE> method is implicitly
called by <CODE>storage::close()</CODE>. If fault happened before 
<CODE>storage::commit()</CODE> operation, all changes will be undone by coping 
modified pages from transaction log to the storage data file. Also all changes 
can be undone explicitly by <CODE>storage::rollback()</CODE> method. To choose
transaction based model of data file access, specify 
<CODE>storage::use_transaction_log</CODE> attribute for 
<CODE>storage::open()</CODE> method.<P>

Another approach to providing data consistency is based on 
copy on write mechanism. In this case original file is not affected. 
Any attempt to modify page that is mapped on the file, cause creation
copy of the page, which is allocated from system swap and has read-write 
access. File is updated only by explicit call of <CODE>storage::flush()</CODE> 
method. This method writes data to temporary file (with suffix ".tmp") 
and then renames this file to original one. 
So this operation cause an atomic update of the file (certainly if 
operating system can guaranty atomicity of <CODE>rename()</CODE> operation).<P>

<B><I>Attention:</I></B> If you are not using transactions,
<CODE>storage::close()</CODE> method doesn't flush data in the file. So if
you don't call <CODE>storage::flush()</CODE> method before 
<CODE>storage::close()</CODE> all modifications done since last 
<CODE>flush</CODE> will be lost.<P>

<B><I>Windows 95 specific:</I></B> In Windows 95 
rename to existing file is not possible, so
original file is first saved in file with name with suffix ".sav".
Then temporary file wit suffix ".tmp" is renamed
to the original name and finally old copy is removed. So if fault
is happened during <CODE>flush()</CODE> operation and after it you find 
no storage file, please do not panic, just look for file with name terminated
with ".sav" suffix and rename it to the original one.<P>

<B><I>Hint:</I></B> I recommend you to use transactions if you are planning
to save data during program execution. It is also possible with
copy on write approach but it is much more expensive. Also transactions are
always preferable if size of storage is large, because creating temporary
copy of file will require a lot of disk space and time.<P>

There are several attributes, which can be passed to storage 
<CODE>open()</CODE> method:

<DL>
<DT><B>support_virtual_functions</B><DD> 
This attribute should be set if objects 
with virtual functions are placed in the storage. If this attribute is not set,
POST++ decides that all persistent objects contain references only within 
storage (to other objects in the storage). So adjustment of references
should be done only if base address of data file mapping is changed 
(this address is stored in the first word of data file and POST++ always 
tries to map file to the same address to avoid unnecessary reference 
adjustment). But if object class contains virtual functions, pointer to 
virtual table is placed inside object. If you recompile your application, 
address of this table can be changed. POST++ library compares timestamp
of executable image with timestamp stored in database created by this 
application. If these timestamp are not equal, correction of virtual table
pointer should be performed. To get application timestamp POST++
should locate executable file image. Unfortunately there is no portable
way to find out executable file name in Unix. Under Unix POST++ looks 
at the value of environment variable "_", which is set by shell. 
This approach will not work if process was started not by shell
(for example by <CODE>system()</CODE>) or working directory is changed
by <CODE>chdir()</CODE>. The most portable way is to use file
<A HREF = "comptime.cxx">comptime.cxx</A>, which should be compiled each
time you recompile your application and linked together with storage
library. There is no such problem in Windows, where name of executable image
can be obtained by Win32 API. While storage 
opening POST++ compares this timestamp with timestamp stored in the data file 
and if they are different and <CODE>support_virtual_functions</CODE> attribute 
is specified then correction of all objects (by calling default constructor) 
will be done.

<DT><B>read_only</B><DD>
By setting this attribute programmer says that he wants only readonly access
to the data file. POST++ will create readonly view of the data file and any 
attempt to change some object in the storage or allocate new one will cause 
protection violation fault. There is one exception: if it is impossible to map
data file to the same address or application is changed and 
<CODE>support_virtual_functions</CODE> is specified, then protection of region
is temporary changed to copy on write and conversion of loaded objects takes 
place.

<DT><B>use_transaction_log</B><DD>
Setting of this attribute force using transactions for all data file
updates. Shadow page strategy is used for implementing transactions.
Transaction is opened implicitly when storage first modification
of storage is done. It is closed explicitly either by 
<CODE>storage::commit()</CODE> or by <CODE>storage::rollback()</CODE>
operations. Method <CODE>storage::commit()</CODE> saves all modified
pages on disk and truncates transaction log, method 
<CODE>storage::rollback()</CODE> undo all changes made within this transaction.

<DT><B>no_file_mapping</B><DD>
By default POST++ will map data file to the process virtual memory.
Time of opening database is greatly reduced in this case, because pages 
of the file will be loaded on demand. But if size of database is not so large
or all data from the database need to be accessed immediately, then
reading file to memory can be preferable to using virtual memory mapping
because no extra overhead of handling page faults takes place in this case.
Flag <code>no_file_mapping</code> prevents POST++ from mapping file
and cause reading it in allocated memory segment.

<DT><B>fault_tolerant</B><DD>
This flag should be used by applications which want to preserve database 
consistency in case of system or application fault. It is not necessary to 
specify this flag if <code>use_transaction_log</code> flag is used, because
consistency will be provided by transaction mechanism in this case.
If <code>use_transaction_log</code> flag is not specified and
flag <code>fault_tolerant</code> flag is set, POST++ will not change
original file preserving its consistency. This is achieved either by
reading file in memory (if flag <code>no_file_mapping</code> is set)
or using copy-on-write pages protection. In last case attempt of
modification of mapped on file page will cause creation copy of the page 
in system swap file. Method <code>flush()</code> will save in-memory
image of database to temporary file and then rename it to original file
using atomic operation. If <code>fault_tolerant</code> flag is not specified,
POST++ do in-place modification of database pages, providing maximal
application performance (because there is no overhead caused by 
copying modified pages and saving database image in temporary file)
As far as modified pages are 
not flushed to the disk immediately, some changes can be lost as a result
of system fault (the worst thing is that some modified pages can be saved
to the disk while other not - so database consistency can be violated).

<DT><B>do_garbage_collection</B><DD>
When this attribute is set POST++ will perform garbage collection in
storage during opening. The operation of collecting garbage 
is combined with reference adjustment. Using garbage collection is always
more safer than manual memory deallocation (due to the problem of 
hanging references), but explicit memory deallocation has less overhead. 
Garbage collection in POST++ has one more advantage in comparison with
explicit deallocation: garbage collector performs utilization of
pages used for small objects. If there are no more allocated small
objects at the page then garbage collector will include this page
in the list of free pages. This is not done for explicit deallocation because
free cells for small objects are linked in chain and it is not so easier
to remove them from this chain (in case of garbage collector all chains
are reconstructed). Even if you are using explicit memory deallocation,
I suggest you to do time by time garbage collection to check for
reference consistency and absence of memory leaks 
(<CODE>garbage_collection</CODE> method returns number of deallocated 
objects and if you are sure that you have explicitly deallocate all
unreachable objects, then this number should be zero).
As far as garbage collector modifies all objects in the storage (set mark bit),
relink free objects in chains), running GC in transaction mode can be
time and disk space consuming operation (all pages from the file will be copied
to the transaction log file). 
</DL><P>

You can specify maximal size for storage files by 
<CODE>file::max_file_size</CODE> variable. If size of data file is less
than <CODE>file::max_file_size</CODE> and mode is not <CODE>read_only</CODE>,
then extra <CODE>size_of_file - file::max_file_size</CODE> bytes of 
virtual space will be reserved after the file mapping region. 
When storage size is extended (because of new objects allocation), 
this pages will be committed (in Windows NT) and used. If size of file is 
greater than <CODE>file::max_file_size</CODE> or <CODE>read_only</CODE> mode 
is used, then size of mapped region is exactly the same as the file size. 
Storage extension is not possible in the last case. In Windows I use
<CODE>GlobalMemoryStatus()</CODE> function to obtain information about 
actually available virtual memory in the system and reduce 
<CODE>file::max_file_size</CODE> to this value. Unfortunately I found no
portable call in Unix which can be used for the same purpose
(<CODE>getrlimit</CODE> doesn't return actual information about available 
virtual memory for users process).<P>

Interface to object storage is specified in file 
<A HREF = "storage.h">storage.h</A> and implementation can be found in
<A HREF = "storage.cxx">storage.cxx</A>. Operating system dependent part
of mapped on memory file is encapsulated within <CODE>file</CODE> class,
which definition is in <A HREF = "file.h">file.h</A> and implementation
in <A HREF = "file.cxx">file.cxx</A>.<P>


<H2><A NAME = "installation">Installation of POST++</A></H2>

Installation of POST++ is very simple. It is now checked for the following 
platforms: Digital Unix, Linux, Solaris, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 95. 
I expect no problems with most of all other new Unix dialect (AIX, 
HP-UX 10, SCO...). Unfortunately I have no access to this systems.
At Windows I compiled POST++ by Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 and Borland 5.02 
compilers. Makefile for Visual C++ is  <A HREF = "makefile.mvc">makefile</A>,
and makefile for Broland C++ is <A HREF = "makefile.mvc">makefile</A>.<P>

The only thing that you are needed to use POST++ is library
(<CODE>libstorage.a</CODE> at Unix and <CODE>storage.lib</CODE> at Windows).
This library can be produced by just issuing <CODE>make</CODE>
command.  There is special <CODE>MAKE.BAT</CODE> for Microsoft Visual C++ 
which invokes <CODE>NMAKE</CODE> with <CODE>makefile.mvc</CODE> as input
(if your are using Borland either edit this file or invoke Borland
make by <CODE>make.exe -f makefile.bcc</CODE> command).<P>
 
Installation in Unix can be completed by copying POST++ library and header
files to some standard system catalogs. You should set proper values for
<code>INSTALL_LIB_PATH</code> and <code>INSTALL_INC_PATH</code>
variables in makefile and execute <code>make install</code> command.
Default value for <code>INSTALL_LIB_PATH</code> is <code>/usr/local/lib</code>
and for <code>INSTALL_INC_PATH</code> is <code>/usr/local/include</code>.
You can avoid copying of POST++ files in system catalogs by specifying
path to POST++ catalog to compiler and linker explicitly.<P>


<H2><A NAME = "classes">POST++ class library</A></H2>

POST++ contains definition of some persistent classes, which 
can be used in your application and also are good examples of 
developing classes for POST++. You can see that there are almost no POST 
specific code in the implementation of these classes.
These classes include array, matrix, string, L2-list, hash table, AVL-tree, 
R-tree, text object. R-tree provides fast access to spatial object 
(object with spatial coordinates). Text object contains modification of 
Boyer and Moore algorithm extended to search multiple patterns combined by 
OR/AND relation. Definition of these classes can be found in following files:

In the article "A study of index structures for main memory database management
systems" T.J. Lehman and M.J Carey proposed T-trees as a storage efficient data
structure for main memory databases. T-trees are based on AVL trees proposed
by Adelson-Velsky and Landis. In this subsection, we provide an overview of 
T-trees as implemented in POST++.<P> 

Like AVL trees, the
height of left and right subtrees of a T-tree may differ by at most one.
Unlike AVL trees, each node in a T-tree stores multiple key values in a sorted
order, rather than
a single key value. The left-most and the right-most key value in a node
define the range of key values contained in the node. Thus, the left subtree
of a node contains only key values less than the left-most key value, while the
right subtree contains key values greater than the right-most key value in the
node. A key value which is falls between the smallest and largest key values in
a node is said to be <I>bounded</I> by that node. 
Note that keys equal to the smallest
or largest key in the node may or may not be considered to be bounded based on
whether the index is unique and based on the search condition (e.g.
"greater-than" versus "greater-than or equal-to").<P>

A node with both a left and
a right child is referred to as an <I>internal node</I>, 
a node with only one child is referred to as a <I>semi-leaf</I>, 
and a node with no children is referred to as a <I>leaf</I>. 
In order to keep occupancy high, every internal node has a minimum number
of key values that it must contain (typically <I>k-2</I>, if <I>k</I>
is the maximum number
of keys that can be stored in a node). However, there is no occupancy condition
on the leaves or semi-leaves.<P>

Searching for a key value in a T-tree is
relatively straightforward. For every node, a check is made to see if the key
value is bounded by the left-most and the right-most key value in the node; if
this is the case, then the key value is returned if it is contained in the node
(else, the key value is not contained in the tree). Otherwise, if the key value
is less than the left-most key value, then the left child node is searched;
else the right child node is searched. The process is repeated until either the
key is found or the node to be searched is null.<P>

Insertions and deletions into
the T-tree are a bit more complicated. For insertions, first a variant of the
search described above is used to find the node that bounds the key value to
be inserted. If such a node exists, then if there is room in the node, the key
value is inserted into the node. If there is no room in the node, then the key
value is inserted into the node and the left-most key value in the node is
inserted into the left subtree of the node (if the left subtree is empty, then
a new node is allocated and the left-most key value is inserted into it). If no
bounding node is found then let <I>N</I> be the last node encountered by the 
failed search and proceed as follows: If <I>N</I>
has room, the key value is inserted into <I>N</I>;
else, it is inserted into a new node that is either the right or left child of
<I>N</I>, depending on the key value and the left-most and right-most key 
values in 
<I>N</I>.<P>

Deletion of a key value begins by determining the node containing the key
value, and the key value is deleted from the node. If deleting the key value
results in an empty leaf node, then the node is deleted. If the deletion
results in an internal node or semi-leaf containing fewer than the minimum
number of key values, then the deficit is made up by moving the largest key in
the left subtree into the node, or by merging the node with its right child.
<P> 

In both insert and delete, allocation/deallocation of a node may cause the 
tree
to become unbalanced and rotations (RR, RL, LL, LR) may need
to be performed. (The heights of subtrees in the following description include
the effects of the insert or delete.) In the case of an insert, nodes along
the path from the newly allocated node to the root are examined until either 

<OL>
<LI>a node for which the two subtrees have equal heights is found 
(in this case no rotation needs to be performed), or
<LI>a node for which the difference in
heights between the left and the right subtrees is more than one is found and a
single rotation involving the node is performed. 
</OL><P>

In the case of delete, nodes
along the path from the de-allocated node's parent to the root are examined
until a node is found whose subtrees' heights now differ by one. Furthermore,
every time a node whose subtrees' heights differ by more than one is
encountered, a rotation is performed. Note that de-allocation of a node may
result in multiple rotations.<P>


There are several test programs for testing classes from POST++ persistent 
class library, which are included in default make target:<P>

<H2><A NAME = "stl">Using STL classes with POST++</A></H2>
It is possible to store and retrieve STL classes from the POST++ storage.
POST++ provides special STL allocator and redefined operators new/delete
for making STL objects persistent. There are several models of making STL 
classes persistent, controlled by the following macros:

<DL>
<DT><CODE>USE_MICROSOFT_STL</CODE>
<DD>Uses Microsoft STL classes, which are shipped with Microsoft Visual C++ 
compiler. This library is not fully complaint with C++ STL standard.
<DD><DT><CODE>USE_STD_ALLOCATORS</CODE>
<DD>Implements allocators as specified in the C++ standard. 
Allocator object is included in the STL object and instance methods of
the allocator object are used for space allocation/deallocation.
So it is possible to implement "smart" allocators: allocator will 
allocate space for the object in the POST++ storage only when the object 
containing this allocator was also placed in the storage. Otherwise, space
for the object will be allocated in the normal way by standard 
<code>malloc()<code> function. 
This option can be used with SGI STL library as well as with 
Microsoft STL library. Note that standard-conforming allocators in SGI
STL use many language features that are not yet widely implemented.  
In particular, they rely on
member templates, partial specialization, partial ordering of function
templates, the typename keyword, and the use of the template keyword
to refer to a template member of a dependent type. So only few C++ compilers
will be able to compile SGI STL library when this macro is defined.
If this macro is not set, then POST provides allocator with static member 
functions and all objects are allocated in the POST++ storage. Only one POST++ 
storage can be opened at each moment of time by the application which uses such
allocator. 
<DD><DT><CODE>REDEFINE_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR</CODE>
<DD>
There two ways of making STL object persistent.
One way is to introduce new type:
<PRE>
typedef basic_string&lt;char, char_traits&lt;char&gt;, post_alloc&lt;char&gt; &gt; post_string;
</PRE>
Another way is to made all classes persistent capable. When 
<code>REDEFINE_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR</code> macro is defined, any STL class can be allocated in the POST++ storage. To create new object in
the persistent storage, you should specify the storage as extra parameter of 
new operator. If storage is omitted, then object will be allocated using 
standard <code>malloc()</code> function.
</DL><P>

POST++ interface to STL do not require any changes in STL classes so you can 
use any STL implementation you want. But as a result, STL classes don't 
contain type descriptors and so POST++ has no information about format of STL 
objects. So POST++ is not able to perform garbage collection and references 
adjustment. When STL interface is used POST++ storage should be always mapped 
to the same virtual address. If you pass <code>storage::fixed</code> flag 
to the <code>storage::open(int flags)</code> method, then POST++ will report
error and <code>open</code> will return <code>false</code> if it is not 
possible to map the storage to the same memory address. But if your 
application is working only with one storage and do not map other object on
virtual memory, then in almost all operating it will be possible to map the
storage to the same memory address.<P>

POST++ interface to STL library is defined in 
<A HREF="post_stl.h">post_stl.h</A> header file. This file should be included
before any STL include file. Also macros <code>REDEFINE_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR</code>
, <code>USE_STD_ALLOCATORS</code> and <code>USE_MICROSOFT_STL</code> should
be defined before <code>post_stl.h</code>.<P>

POST++ contains example of working with STL++ classes 
<A HREF="stltest.cxx">stltest.cxx</A>. This example uses two STL classes - 
<code>string</code> and <code>vector</code>. The lines readen from standard 
input are pushed in the vector and when program is started once again all 
elements of the vector are printed to the standard output. 
This example is included in default target of the makefile for 
Microsoft Visual C++ (it uses Microsoft  STL classes shipped with VC). 
You can also try to build this test with
some other version of STL library but do not forget about
<code>REDEFINE_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR</code> and <code>USE_STD_ALLOCATORS</code> 
macros. This example was also tested with SGI STLport 3.12 and GCC 2.8.1.<P>


<H2><A NAME = "new">Replacing of standard allocators</A></H2>

In previous section I explain how to use POST++ with STL library.
But there are a lot of other C++ and C libraries and application which
you can want to use, but which don't provide such flexible allocators
mechanism as STL. In this case the only possible solution (if you do not want
or can not change sources of these libraries) is replacing of 
standard allocation mechanism with one provided by POST++. So any
dynamically allocated object will be created in POST++ storage 
(only one storage can be used in this case).<P>

POST++ distribution contains file
<code>postnew.cxx</code> which redefines standard <code>malloc, free, 
realloc</code> and <code>calloc</code> functions. When storage is opened, 
all objects are allocated in this storage. Otherwise <code>sbrk()</code>
function is used for allocating objects (space allocated for such 
object is not reclaimed). It is possible not to touch this standard C 
allocation functions and redefine only default C++ operator new and delete.
To do it defined <code>DO_NOT_REDEFINE_MALLOC</code> macro when compiling
<code>postnew.cxx</code>. Object file produced from <code>postnew.cxx</code>
should be passed to the linker before standard C library.<P>

As an example of such POST++ usage you can look at <code>testnew.cxx</code>
and <code>testqt.cxx</code>. First one illustrate how standard C++
arrays are made persistent. And second one illustrate how POST++ can be used
with Qt class library.<P>

As far as POST++ has no information about format of stored classes
there are some restrictions on POST++ usage:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Classes with virtual functions are not supported (POST++ is not able to 
properly initialize pointers to virtual function tables).
<LI>Implicit memory deallocation (garbage collection) is not possible - POST++
has no information about location of pointers inside objects.
<LI>Storage should always be mapped to the same virtual address because POST++
is not able to adjust pointers if base address is changed. 
</OL>

If all these restrictions are not critical for your application, you can 
made it persistent without almost any code modification. This approach can be
used both for C and C++ programs.<P>


<H2><A NAME = "usage">How to use POST++</A></H2>

There are some examples of classes and application for POST++. 
The simplest of them is game <I>"Guess an animal"</I>. Algorithm of
this game is very simple and the result looks rather impressive 
(something like artificial intelligence). Moreover this game is very good 
example, illustrating benefits of persistent object storage. 
Sources of this game are in file <A HREF = "guess.cxx">guess.cxx</A>. 
Building of this game is included in default make target. 
To run it just execute <CODE>guess</CODE>.
<P>

<B><I>Unix specific: </I></B> 
When you will link your Unix application with POST++ library 
and persisent objects in application contain virtual functions, please do not 
forget to recompile <A HREF = "comptime.cxx">comptime.cxx</A> file and include
it in the linker's list. This file is necessary for POST++ to
provide executable file timestamp, which is placed in the storage and 
used to determine when application is changed and reinitialization
of virtual function table pointers in objects is needed. 
<B><I>Attention!</I></B> This file should be recompiled each time your are 
relinking your application. I suggest you to make compiler to call linker for
you and include <CODE>comptime.cxx</CODE> source file in the list of object 
files for the target of building executable image 
(see <A HREF = "makefile">makefile</A>).<P>


<H2><A NAME = "debugging">Specific of debugging POST++ applications</A></H2>

Information in this section is meaningful only for application using
transactions. POST++ uses page protection mechanism to provide creation of 
shadow page on the original page modification, After storage opening or
transaction commit all mapped on file pages are read-only protected.
So any attempt to modify contents of the object allocated at this page will
cause access violation exception. This exception is handled by 
special POST++ handler. But if you are using debugger, it will 
catch this exception first and stop application. If you want to debug
your application you should do some preparations:

<UL>
<LI> In Unix it is enough to tell debugger not to catch SIGSEGV signal.
For example for GDB it can be done with command: 
<CODE>handle SIGSEGV nostop noprint pass</CODE>. If SIGSEGV signal
is not caused by storage page protection violation, but due to a bug
in your program, POST++ exception handler will "understand" that it is
not his exception and send SIGABRT signal to the self process, which
can be normally catched by debugger.

<LI> In Windows POST++ uses unhandled exception filter to
handle storage page protection violations. Unfortunately it is impossible
to make Microsoft Debugger to ignore unhandled exceptions. If you
are going to debug your application, you should enclose all your program code 
(<CODE>main</CODE> or <CODE>WinMain</CODE> function) with structured 
exception block. You should always use structured exception handling 
with Borland C++, because Unhandled Exception Filter is not correctly called 
in Borland. Please use two macros <CODE>SEN_TRY</CODE> and 
<CODE>SEN_ACCESS_VIOLATION_HANDLER()</CODE> to enclose body of main 
(or WinMain) function:

<PRE>
      main() { 
          SEN_TRY { 
               ...
          } SEN_ACCESS_VIOLATION_HANDLER();
          return 0;
      }
</PRE>

Be sure that Debugger behavior for this exception is "Stop if not handled"
and not "Stop always" (you can check it in Debug/Exceptions menu).
In file <A HREF = "testrans.cxx">testrans.cxx</A> you can find example of
using structured exception handling.
</UL>


<H2><A NAME = "PS">Some more information about POST++</A></H2>

POST++ is freeware. It is distributed in hope of been useful. You can do
with it anything you want (with no limitation on distributing products
using POST++). I will be glad to help you in using POST++ and receive
all kind of information (bug reports, suggestions...) about POST++.
Freeware status of POST++ doesn't mean lack of support. I promice you to
do my best to fix all reported bugs. Also e-mail support is guaranteed.
POST++ can be used for various purposes: storing information between session,
storing object system in file, snapshots, informational systems...
